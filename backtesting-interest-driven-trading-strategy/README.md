# Interest Rateâ€“Driven Trading Strategy

## Overview

This project implements a rule-based trading strategy that responds to changes in long-term interest rates. The strategy generates buy and sell signals based on interest rate movements, applies trading fees, and computes associated returns. It compares the performance of the strategy to the market and calculates the abnormal return generated by the signals.

The approach provides a basic framework for evaluating the impact of macroeconomic indicators (e.g., interest rates) on equity trading decisions.

## Contents

### `interest_rate_strategy.py`

Implements the core logic for the strategy:

**Functions:**

* `create_signal(interest, stock, trading_fee)`
  Generates a trading signal (`+1` for buy, `-1` for sell) based on the day-over-day change in long-term interest rates. A trading fee is included to simulate execution costs.

* `calculate_returns(signal, stock)`
  Computes three series of returns:

  * **Market Return**: Daily return from holding the stock.
  * **Strategy Return**: Daily return from following the interest-rate-based signals.
  * **Abnormal Return**: Difference between the strategy and market returns.

* `plot_cumulative_returns(df)`
  Plots cumulative performance of market return, strategy return, and abnormal return.

## Strategy Logic

* If interest rates **increase**, the strategy **buys** the stock the following day.
* If interest rates **decrease or stay flat**, the strategy **sells** the stock the next day.
* A **trading fee** is applied to each position to account for transaction costs.

## Example Workflow

```python
# Load stock and interest rate data
firm = pd.read_csv('WFC_2011.csv')
interest_data = pd.read_csv('interest_data.csv')

# Align date indices
firm.index = pd.to_datetime(firm['Date'])
interest_data.index = pd.to_datetime(interest_data['Date'])

# Trim the data to a specific time window
firm = firm.loc['2023-02-02':'2023-12-29']
interest_data = interest_data.loc['2023-02-02':'2023-12-29']

# Create trading signals and compute returns
signal_df = create_signal(interest_data, firm, trading_fee=0.0025)
returns = calculate_returns(signal_df, firm)

# Plot performance
returns.plot(title='Market vs. Strategy Return')
plot_cumulative_returns(returns)
```
