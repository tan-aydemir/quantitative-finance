This repository showcases a series of quantitative finance projects that explore a wide range of financial concepts through Python-based implementations. The work combines theoretical foundations with practical applications, covering topics in derivatives pricing, risk management, statistical modeling, and portfolio construction.

## Project Highlights

### Option Pricing Models
Includes models for pricing both vanilla and exotic options. These projects explore the Black-Scholes-Merton framework, binomial trees, and Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate European and path-dependent options, as well as compute sensitivities like delta and implied volatility.

### Bond Valuation
Implements bond pricing models by discounting future cash flows and analyzing yield over different compounding periods. These models support understanding of interest rate effects and fixed-income instruments.

### Risk Quantification
Applies Monte Carlo methods and historical data to simulate asset returns and quantify financial risk. Includes techniques such as Value at Risk (VaR), maximum drawdown analysis, and visualizations of simulated price paths.

### Statistical Analysis
Uses descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis to examine return distributions, calculate core performance metrics, and build foundational insights from financial datasets.

### Trading Strategy Backtesting
Develops and tests rule-based trading strategies driven by macroeconomic indicators such as interest rate changes. Performance is compared against market benchmarks using return and risk metrics.

### Passive Investment Techniques
Models disciplined investing methods like dollar-cost averaging and periodic rebalancing. These projects simulate portfolio growth under varying market conditions and investment schedules.

### Portfolio Optimization
Constructs and evaluates multi-asset portfolios using both equal weighting and mean-variance optimization. Tracks performance with cumulative returns, Value at Risk, and drawdown, both with and without rebalancing strategies.

## Getting Started

Each project is self-contained and implemented in Python using widely adopted libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy
