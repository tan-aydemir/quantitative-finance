# Quantitative Finance Projects

Here is a collection of projects I’ve worked on last semester to explore key topics in quantitative finance. I’ve used Python to build models that bridge theory and practice, which ranged from derivatives pricing to portfolio optimization. These projects reflect both my academic background and personal interest in applying data-driven approaches to financial decision-making.

## What I’ve Built

### Option Pricing Models

I implemented models for pricing both vanilla and exotic options using frameworks like Black-Scholes-Merton, binomial trees, and Monte Carlo simulations. I also computed sensitivities like delta and implied volatility to deepen my understanding of option mechanics.

### Bond Valuation

Here, I built tools to calculate bond prices by discounting future cash flows and analyzing how yields behave under different compounding assumptions. It helped me grasp the impact of interest rates on fixed-income securities.

### Risk Quantification

Using Monte Carlo simulations and historical return data, I modeled asset behavior and estimated risk measures like Value at Risk (VaR) and max drawdown. I visualized simulated price paths to explore different scenarios.

### Statistical Analysis

In this section, I performed exploratory data analysis to understand return distributions and calculate performance metrics. These tools helped me develop a foundation for evaluating financial datasets.

### Trading Strategy Backtesting

I tested rule-based trading strategies based on macroeconomic indicators like interest rate changes. I compared their performance to benchmarks using metrics like cumulative returns and Sharpe ratios.

### Passive Investment Techniques

I modeled strategies like dollar-cost averaging and periodic rebalancing to simulate long-term portfolio growth under different market conditions and investment cadences.

### Portfolio Optimization

Here, I constructed multi-asset portfolios using both equal weighting and mean-variance optimization. I tracked performance through cumulative returns, Value at Risk, and drawdown metrics — both with and without rebalancing.

## How to Get Started

Each project is written in Python and uses standard libraries. To get started, you can install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy
```
